# ðŸ’§ Water Intake Tracker

A modern, AI-powered web application to help users track their daily water intake, get smart feedback, and stay hydrated. Built with Streamlit for the dashboard and FastAPI for the backend, this project demonstrates clean architecture, modular code, and practical use of AI agents.
